# Product Architecture Skill

## Purpose
Design feature delivery with senior-grade sequencing and no blind implementation.

## Inputs
- Feature request and success criteria.
- Current impacted module list.
- Existing constraints from `AGENTS.md` and instruction files.

## Workflow (7 phases + 2 gates)
1. Phase 0 preflight baseline.
2. Phase 1 research/discovery.
3. Phase 2 threat model/security.
4. Phase 3 wiring blueprint.
5. Phase 4 implementation plan.
6. Phase 5 verification design.
7. Phase 6 correction loop.
8. Phase 7 handover/future-proofing.
9. Phase 8 post-merge validation.

## Deliverables
- Dependency map.
- Impacted file list.
- Feature sequence recommendation.
- Risk register with mitigation order.

## Stop Conditions
- Missing data contracts.
- Unclear ownership boundaries.
- Unresolved security assumptions.
